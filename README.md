This is the second exercise at the UBIQUM bootcamp.

I have been asked to create a demo web app displaying Congressional data from the ProPublica Congress API on an HTML page.
Specifically, I need to create three pages, Home, and one each for the Senate and one for the House of Representatives.
Both will have to look very similar while trying to avoid duplicating code as much as possible.
